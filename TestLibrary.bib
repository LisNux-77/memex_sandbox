These are long-standing questions that have proven difficult to answer. To test between competing hypotheses, we constructed a massive repository of historical and archaeological information known as “Seshat: Global History Databank.” We systematically coded data on 414 societies from 30 regions around the world spanning the last 10,000 years. We were able to capture information on 51 variables reflecting nine characteristics of human societies, such as social scale, economy, features of governance, and information systems. Our analyses revealed that these different characteristics show strong relationships with each other and that a single principal component captures around three-quarters of the observed variation. Furthermore, we found that different characteristics of social complexity are highly predictable across different world regions. These results suggest that key aspects of social organization are functionally related and do indeed coevolve in predictable ways. Our findings highlight the power of the sciences and humanities working together to rigorously test hypotheses about general rules that may have shaped human history.},

Located ‘in the wild’, and timed to coincide with the 2014 Centenary of the First World War, WNEIS transformed Cardiff’s civic centre as previously inaccessible stories and archival materials were projected onto, and playfully manipulated by, buildings and the natural environment. The research that underpinned the project unearthed a hitherto untold story about the experiences and fates of those who left their posts at Amgueddfa Cymru – National Museum Wales to go and fight in WW1. Focusing on the story of Botanist Cyril Mortimer Green, and moving between past and present, known and unknown, presence and absence, participants encountered a re-scripting and multiple layering of the cityscape, and an uneasy archaeology of the museological endeavour. WNEIS foregrounded opportunities for touching, listening and feeling; as such it was a multimodal form of investigation for participants. This article uses focus group materials to explore the intersecting themes of ‘embodiment’, ‘empathy’ and ‘silence’ that emerged in reflections. It reveals an audience ready for digital cultural heritage that embraces ambiguity in the examination and negotiation of meaning.},

In contrast to conventional web interfaces, we witness a widening spectrum of innovative visualization types specially designed for rich collections from the cultural heritage sector. This new class of information visualizations gives rise to a notable diversity of interaction and representation techniques while lending currency and urgency to a discussion about principles such as serendipity, generosity, and criticality in connection with visualization design. With this survey, we review information visualization approaches to digital cultural heritage collections and reﬂect on the state of the art in techniques and design choices.

Therefore, we introduce the concept of open methodology, which stands for sharing the methodological details of the evaluation provided, and the tools used for data collection and analysis. We discuss the potential benefits, but also the issues of an open science, and conclude with a set of recommendations for implementing open science in TEL.},

Open science has therefore become an increasingly important topic. Moreover, as open science is actively pursued by several high-profile funders and institutions, it has fast become a crucial matter to all researchers.

Popular models that learn such representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of character n-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character n-gram; words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows us to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training data. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on word similarity and analogy tasks. By comparing to recently proposed morphological word representations, we show that our vectors achieve state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.},

	abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder–decoders and encode a source sentence into a ﬁxed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a ﬁxed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder–decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

By including tasks with limited training data, GLUE is designed to favor and encourage models that share general linguistic knowledge across tasks. GLUE also includes a hand-crafted diagnostic test suite that enables detailed linguistic analysis of models. We evaluate baselines based on current methods for transfer and representation learning and ﬁnd that multi-task training on all tasks performs better than training a separate model per task.

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pretrain deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁnetuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial taskspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.},

	abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classiﬁer in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the ﬂexibility of these methods by explaining diﬀerent models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classiﬁcation (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classiﬁer, and identifying why a classiﬁer should not be trusted.},

	abstract = {The blind application of machine learning runs the risk of amplifying biases present in data. Such a danger is facing us with word embedding, a popular framework to represent text data as vectors which has been used in many machine learning and natural language processing tasks. We show that even word embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because their widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these biases. Geometrically, gender bias is ﬁrst shown to be captured by a direction in the word embedding. Second, gender neutral words are shown to be linearly separable from gender deﬁnition words in the word embedding. Using these properties, we provide a methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes, such as the association between between the words receptionist and female, while maintaining desired associations such as between the words queen and female. We deﬁne metrics to quantify both direct and indirect gender biases in embeddings, and develop algorithms to “debias” the embedding. Using crowd-worker evaluation as well as standard benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms signiﬁcantly reduce gender bias in embeddings while preserving the its useful properties such as the ability to cluster related concepts and to solve analogy tasks. The resulting embeddings can be used in applications without amplifying gender bias.},

The main drawback of NPLMs is their extremely long training and testing times. Morin and Bengio have proposed a hierarchical language model built around a binary tree of words, which was two orders of magnitude faster than the nonhierarchical model it was based on. However, it performed considerably worse than its non-hierarchical counterpart in spite of using a word tree created using expert knowledge. We introduce a fast hierarchical language model along with a simple feature-based algorithm for automatic construction of word trees from the data. We then show that the resulting models can outperform non-hierarchical neural models as well as the best n-gram models.},

We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. The result is a new global logbilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efﬁciently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. The model produces a vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 75\% on a recent word analogy task. It also outperforms related models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition.},

In this paper, we show how universal sentence representations trained using the supervised data of the Stanford Natural Language Inference datasets can consistently outperform unsupervised methods like SkipThought vectors (Kiros et al., 2015) on a wide range of transfer tasks. Much like how computer vision uses ImageNet to obtain features, which can then be transferred to other tasks, our work tends to indicate the suitability of natural language inference for transfer learning to other NLP tasks.

Five methods were evaluated, including term selection based on document frequency (DF), information gain (IG), mutual information (MI), a  Ø  2  -test (CHI), and term strength (TS). We found IG and CHI most effective in our experiments. Using IG thresholding with a knearest neighbor classifier on the Reuters corpus, removal of up to 98\% removal of unique terms actually yielded an improved classification accuracy (measured by average precision) . DF thresholding performed similarly. Indeed we found strong correlations between the DF, IG and CHI values of a term. This suggests that DF thresholding, the simplest method with the lowest cost in computation, can be reliably used instead of IG or CHI when the computation of these measures are too expensive. TS compares favorably with the other methods with up to 50\% vocabulary redu...},

This is done by visualizing normalized textual data as a graph and deriving the key metrics for the concepts and for the text as a whole using network analysis. The resulting data and graph representation are then used to detect the key concepts, which function as junctions for meaning circulation within a text, contextual clusters comprised of word communities (themes), as well as the most often used pathways for meaning circulation. We then discuss several practical applications of our method ranging from automatic recovery of hidden agendas within a text and intertextual navigation graph-interfaces, to enhancing reading and writing, quick text summarization, as well as group sentiment profiling and text diagramming. We also make a quick overview of the existing computer-assisted text analysis (and, specifically, network text analysis), and text visualization methods in order to position our research in relation to the other available approaches.},

Es kann dazu verwendet werden um digitale Dokumente in vielerlei Formaten wie zum Beispiel einfache Textdateien, XML-Dateien oder Graphiken zu bearbeiten wobei bearbeiten in diesem Zusammenhang vor allem strukturieren und verlinken bedeutet. Diese Strukturierung nach einem neu entwickelten Kodierungschema kann zum Beispiel auf formalen, linguistischen, semantischen, historischen oder auch vielen anderen Gesichtspunkten beruhen. Die Dokumente können gleichzeitig mit beliebig vielen parallelen und sich möglicherweise auch überlappenden Strukturen versehen werden und bezüglich jeder dieser Strukturen auch miteinander verknüpft werden. Die unterschiedlichen Strukturen können je nach Art entweder automatisch oder halbautomatisch erzeugt werden oder sie können vom Benutzer manuell spezifiziert werden. Als Grundlage des vorgestellten Systems dient XTE, ein einfaches aber zugleich mächtiges, externe Kodierungsschema das sowohl als eine XML DTD als auch als ein XML Schema verwirklicht wurde. XTE ist besonders zum Kodieren von vielen, sich gegenseitig überlappenden Hierarchien in multi-modalen Dokumenten und zum Verknüpfen dieser Strukturen über mehrere Dokumente hinweg, geeignet. Zusammen mit XTE wurden zwei ausgereifte Anwendungen zum Betrachten und Bearbeiten von XTE-kodierten Dokumenten sowie zum komfortablen Arbeiten mit den so erstellten Ergebnisdokumenten geschaffen. Diese Anwendungen wurden als anpassbares und erweiterbares System konzipiert, das möglichst einfach für andere Einsatzgebiete und an neue Benutzerwünsche angepasst werden können soll. Die Kombination einer klassischen Synopse zusammen mit den vorhandenen Erweiterungsmöglichkeiten mittels Wörterbüchern, Lexika und Multi-Media Elementen die das System bietet, machen es zu einem Werkzeug das auf vielen Gebieten, angefangen von der Text-Analyse und dem Sprachenlernen über die Erstellung textkritischer Editionen bis hin zum elektronischen Publizieren, einsetzbar ist. Neben diesem System sind als weitere Ergebnisse dieser Arbeit verschiedene Werkzeuge für die Softwaredokumentation entstanden und zur Dokumentation des Systems eingesetzt worden. Weiterhin wurde eine neuartige, mehrsprachige, graphische Benutzeroberfläche entwickelt, die unter anderem in dem hier beschriebenen System eingesetz wurde.},

However, when dealing with a new task, it is still difficult to quickly select a suitable one from various FS methods provided by many previous studies. In this paper, we propose a theoretic framework of FS methods based on two basic measurements: frequency measurement and ratio measurement. Then six popular FS methods are in detail discussed under this framework. Moreover, with the guidance of our theoretical analysis, we propose a novel method called weighed frequency and odds (WFO) that combines the two measurements with trained weights. The experimental results on data sets from both topic-based and sentiment classification tasks show that this new method is robust across different tasks and numbers of selected features.},

It would be better to understand this field as a conversation between literary studies and social science, inititated by scholars like Raymond Williams and Janice Radway, and moving slowly toward an explicitly experimental method. Candor about the social-scientific dimension of distant reading is needed now, in order to refocus a research agenda that can drift into diffuse exploration of digital tools. Clarity on this topic might also reduce miscommunication between distant readers and digital humanists.},

The article reports on experiments in which support vector machines (SVMs) are employed to recognize translated text in a corpus of Italian articles from the geopolitical domain. An ensemble of SVMs reaches 86.7\% accuracy with 89.3\% precision and 83.3\% recall on this task. A preliminary analysis of the features used by the SVMs suggests that the distribution of function words and morphosyntactic categories in general, and personal pronouns and adverbs in particular, are among the cues used by the SVMs to perform the discrimination task. A follow-up experiment shows that the performance attained by SVMs is well above the average performance of ten human subjects, including five professional translators, on the same task. Our results offer solid evidence supporting the translationese hypothesis, and our method seems to have promising applications in translation studies and in quantitative style analysis in general. Implications for the machine learning/text categorization community are equally important, both because this is a novel application and especially because we provide explicit evidence that a relatively knowledge-poor machine learning algorithm can outperform human beings in a text classification task.},

There are already historical studies of musicology, logic, art history, linguistics, and historiography, but this volume gathers these, and many other humanities disciplines, into a single coherent account. Its central theme is the way in which scholars throughout the ages and in virtually all civilizations have sought to identify patterns in texts, art, music, languages, literature, and the past. What rules can we apply if we wish to determine whether a tale about the past is trustworthy? By what criteria are we to distinguish consonant from dissonant musical intervals? What rules jointly describe all possible grammatical sentences in a language? How can modern digital methods enhance pattern-seeking in the humanities? Rens Bod contends that the hallowed opposition between the sciences (mathematical, experimental, dominated by universal laws) and the humanities (allegedly concerned with unique events and hermeneutic methods) is a mistake born of a myopic failure to appreciate the pattern-seeking that lies at the heart of this inquiry. A New History of the Humanities amounts to a persuasive plea to give Panini, Valla, Bopp, and countless other often overlooked intellectual giants their rightful place next to the likes of Galileo, Newton, and Einstein.},

	abstract = {A new emerging field, that of visual stylometry of art, proposes to apply image analysis and machine learning tools to high-resolution digital images of artwork in order to assist art connoisseurs in determining the painting's likely creator. The premise is that each artist's brushwork is likely to contain features that are characteristic of the artist's unique habitual physical movements; these features could be identified and characterized through machine learning. In this paper, we describe a new technique for this problem. We extract, as features for our classifier, parameters of both Hidden Markov Tree models and linear predictor models of the painting's wavelet coefficients. We then use the FINE dimensionality reduction technique [1] to produce an unsupervised low-dimensional embedding of the data. Tests on two dataset consisting of over 100 high-resolution digital images of impressionist paintings by Van Gogh and contemporaries shows good separation between paintings of Van Gogh and others is achieved via this unsupervised process. We further show (through comparison with the alternative) that our method benefits greatly from (1) using only background sections of each painting in our analysis, (2) the FINE technique, and (3) the use of both HMT and linear predictor features together in the same analysis. All three of these technique choices are new in this paper. We hope that our method can be a tool, used carefully in conjunction with the connoisseur's expertise and other examinations, to determine a painting's true authorship.},

	abstract = {One of the main tasks of the Persistent Identifier Linking Infrastructure (PILIN) project on persistent identifiers was to establish a policy framework for managing identifiers and identifier providers. A major finding from the project was that policy is far more important in guaranteeing persistence of identifiers than technology. Key policy questions for guaranteeing identifier persistence include: what entities should be assigned persistent identifiers, how should those identifiers be exposed to services, and what guarantees does the provider make on how long various facets of the identifiers will persist. To make an informed decision about what to identify, information modelling of the domain is critical. Identifier managers need to know what can be identified discretely (including not only concrete artefacts like files, but also abstractions such as works, versions, presentations, and aggregations); and for which of those objects it is a priority for users and managers to keep track. Without working out what actually needs to be identified, the commitment to keep identifiers persistent becomes meaningless. To make sure persistent identifiers meet these requirements, the PILIN project has formulated a six-point checklist for integrating identifiers into information management, which we present here.},

It also saw the rise of the novel to the height of its cultural power as the most important literary form of the period. This paper reports on a long-term experiment in tracing such macroscopic changes in the novel during this crucial period. Specifically, we present findings on two interrelated transformations in novelistic language that reveal a systemic concretization in language and fundamental change in the social spaces of the novel. We show how these shifts have consequences for setting, characterization, and narration as well as implications for the responsiveness of the novel to the dramatic changes in British society. This paper has a second strand as well. This project was simultaneously an experiment in developing quantitative and computational methods for tracing changes in literary language. We wanted to see how far quantifiable features such as word usage could be pushed toward the investigation of literary history. Could we leverage quantitative methods in ways that respect the nuance and complexity we value in the humanities? To this end, we present a second set of results, the techniques and methodological lessons gained in the course of designing and running this project.},

	abstract = {In a review essay entitled “Shakespeare and Authorship Studies in the Twenty-First Century,” published in Shakespeare Quarterly (62 [2011]: 106–42), Brian Vickers makes a scathing attack upon computational stylistics as a scholarly enterprise and as represented by the book he is reviewing. His principal target is the use of word-frequency patterns as evidence of authorship. He argues that his current approach to the attribution of authorship, an approach that deals in collocations of words, is effective and superior. The book in question, Shakespeare, Computers, and the Mystery of Authorship, edited by Hugh Craig and Arthur Kinney (2009) is best assessed by scholars deeply versed in Shakespeare studies; the consensus may be far more favorable than Vickers expects. The main purpose of this “Second Opinion” is neither to defend Craig and Kinney nor to offer a general survey of the field, but to show that such methods are well suited to the work of attribution. The present essay concludes that, when Vickers overcomes several shortcomings in his own new method, it may well become a useful addition to the scholar’s armory. The reason all this matters is that new methods of analysis are yielding very accurate results. As is sometimes the case with advanced bibliographical methods and the close study of printing-house practice, apparent technical complexity is a barrier to their acceptance. But all of these methods should be judged by their results.},

	abstract = {Discussion of digital identifiers, and persistent identifiers in particular, has often been confused by differences in underlying assumptions and approaches. To bring more clarity to such discussions, the PILIN Project has devised an abstract model of identifiers and identifier services, which is presented here in summary. Given such an abstract model, it is possible to compare different identifier schemes, despite variations in terminology; and policies and strategies can be formulated for persistence without committing to particular systems. The abstract model is formal and layered; in this article, we give an overview of the distinctions made in the model. This presentation is not exhaustive, but it presents some of the key concepts represented, and some of the insights that result. The main goal of the Persistent Identifier Linking Infrastructure (PILIN) project [1] has been to scope the infrastructure necessary for a national persistent identifier service. There are a variety of approaches and technologies already on offer for persistent digital identification of objects. But true identity persistence cannot be bound to particular technologies, domain policies, or information models: any formulation of a persistent identifier strategy needs to outlast current technologies, if the identifiers are to remain persistent in the long term. For that reason, PILIN has modelled the digital identifier space in the abstract. It has arrived at an ontology [2] and a service model [3] for digital identifiers, and for how they are used and managed, building on previous work in the identifier field [4] (including the thinking behind URI [5], DOI [6], XRI [7] and ARK [8]), as well as semiotic theory [9]. The ontology, as an abstract model, addresses the question ‘what is (and isn’t) an identifier?’ and ‘what does an identifier management system do?’. This more abstract view also brings clarity to the ongoing conversation of whether URIs can be (and should be) universal persistent identifiers.},

In some cases reported in the literature, inappropriate statistical methods have been used, and statistical significance of results have not been addressed.

Unfortunately rare events do make up a large fraction of real text.However, more applicable methods based on likelihood ratio tests are available that yield good results with relatively small samples. These tests can be implemented efficiently, and have been used for the detection of composite terms and for the determination of domain-specific terms.

We review examples and a case study of existing scholarly publishing venues that attempt to maintain quality control standards while embracing innovative multimedia formats. We also present lessons learned from the case experience and challenges that face us in the scholarly publication of multimedia.},

	abstract = {The effects of propranolol on mitochondrial ion fluxes have been studied in oscillatory conditions in the presence of potassium plus valinomycin. The drug was able to decrease slightly the rate of swelling and that of passive contraction a little more. When the concentration of external salt was below 10 mM, propranolol decreased the extent of swelling; above 15 mM it was increased by the drug. The inhibition of contraction was abolished by nigericin or raised pH and was less evident with ATP rather than succinate as the source of energy. Propranolol only slightly affected the oxidative phosphorylation and latent ATPase activity of mitochondria. At low concentrations of salts the rate of valinomycin-stimulated respiration and ATPase activity were both inhibited. At higher concentrations of the salts, both were stimulated. It is suggested that the stimulation of respiration and ATPase activity result from increased ion uptake. Propranolol seems to stabilize an “energized” state, possibly by inhibiting the entry of protons, thereby retarding the equilibration of ionic gradients across the inner membrane.},

One test treats of words used with some consistency by a target-author but more sporadically by others. The second treats of words used sporadically by the target-author but not by most others. (The inclusion of words that some other authors use avoids the strict constraint that has impoverished this form of evidence.) In suitable cases, both tests prove very accurate. The fact that evidence of authorship can be detected in these three distinct frequency-strata helps to explain why such tests should work at all and so encourages the development of even better ones.},

	abstract = {Machine learning for text classification is the cornerstone of document categorization, news filtering, document routing, and personalization. In text domains, effective feature selection is essential to make the learning task efficient and more accurate. This paper presents an empirical comparison of twelve feature selection methods (e.g. Information Gain) evaluated on a benchmark of 229 text classification problem instances that were gathered from Reuters, TREC, OHSUMED, etc. The results are analyzed from multiple goal perspectives-accuracy, F-measure, precision, and recall-since each is appropriate in different situations. The results reveal that a new feature selection metric we call 'Bi-Normal Separation' (BNS), outperformed the others by a substantial margin in most situations. This margin widened in tasks with high class skew, which is rampant in text classification problems and is particularly challenging for induction algorithms. A new evaluation methodology is offered that focuses on the needs of the data mining practitioner faced with a single dataset who seeks to choose one (or a pair of) metrics that are most likely to yield the best performance. From this perspective, BNS was the top single choice for all goals except precision, for which Information Gain yielded the best result most often. This analysis also revealed, for example, that Information Gain and Chi-Squared have correlated failures, and so they work poorly together. When choosing optimal pairs of metrics for each of the four performance goals, BNS is consistently a member of the pair---e.g., for greatest recall, the pair BNS + F1-measure yielded the best performance on the greatest number of tasks by a considerable margin.},

	abstract = {Recent research on annotation interfaces provides provocative evidence that anchored, annotation-based discussion environments may lead to better conversations about a text. However, annotation interfaces raise complicated tradeoffs regarding screen real estate and positioning. It is argued that solving this screen real estate problem requires limiting the number of annotations displayed to users. In order to understand which annotations have the most learning value for students, this paper presents two complementary studies examining the effects of annotations on students performing a reading-to-write task. The first study used think-aloud protocols and a within-subjects methodology, finding that annotations appeared to provoke students to reflect more critically upon the primary text. This effect was particularly strong when students encountered pairs of annotations presenting different viewpoints on the same section of text. Student interviews suggested that annotations were most helpful when they caused the reader to consider and weigh conflicting viewpoints. The second study used a between-subjects methodology and a more naturalistic task to provide complementary evidence that annotations encourage more reflective responses to a text. This study found that students who received annotated materials both perceived themselves and were perceived by instructors as less reliant on unreflective summary strategies than students who received the same content but in a different format. These findings indicate that the learning value of an annotation lies in its ability to provoke students to consider and weigh new perspectives on the primary text. When selected effectively, annotations provide a critical scaffolding that can support students’ critical thinking and argumentation activities. Collaborative digital libraries and applications for the Web 2.0 should be designed with this learning framework in mind.},

	abstract = {Within stylometrics, the disciplines of authorial attribution and descriptive stylistics hitherto have been pursued separately. The first has achieved mainstream status within literary studies, while the second is little recognized. A study of the plays of Thomas Middleton compared with a large control sample shows that it is possible to achieve a good classification of his work in 2,000 word segments as against those of his contemporaries, using frequencies of very common words. Such a result can serve as the basis both for testing Middleton's hand in some disputed plays and for a description of his style. Most of The Revenger's Tragedy, part of The Yorkshire Tragedy, and all of The Second Maiden's Tragedy prove to be in a style similar to that of Middleton's uncontested plays. This style, judging by an examination of instances in context of the ten word types most strongly correlated with the Middleton-other discriminant function, is (among other things) rich in deictics and poor in conjunctions, features readily accommodated to previous descriptions including Middleton's own. It is concluded that classification and description can be mutually supportive: the first confirms the validity of the second, while the second helps to establish the stylistic mechanisms underlying a successful classification.},

	abstract = {The dream of capturing and organizing knowledge is as old as history. From the archives of ancient Sumeria and the Library of Alexandria to the Library of Congress and Wikipedia, humanity has wrestled with the problem of harnessing its intellectual output. The timeless quest for wisdom has been as much about information storage and retrieval as creative genius.In Cataloging the World, Alex Wright introduces us to a figure who stands out in the long line of thinkers and idealists who devoted themselves to the task. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, Paul Otlet, a librarian by training, worked at expanding the potential of the catalog card, the world's first information chip. From there followed universal libraries and museums, connecting his native Belgium to the world by means of a vast intellectual enterprise that attempted to organize and code everything ever published. Forty years before the first personal computer and fifty years before the first browser, Otlet envisioned a network of "electric telescopes" that would allow people everywhere to search through books, newspapers, photographs, and recordings, all linked together in what he termed, in 1934, a réseau mondial--essentially, a worldwide web.Otlet's life achievement was the construction of the Mundaneum--a mechanical collective brain that would house and disseminate everything ever committed to paper. Filled with analog machines such as telegraphs and sorters, the Mundaneum--what some have called a "Steampunk version of hypertext"--was the embodiment of Otlet's ambitions. It was also short-lived. By the time the Nazis, who were pilfering libraries across Europe to collect information they thought useful, carted away Otlet's collection in 1940, the dream had ended. Broken, Otlet died in 1944.Wright's engaging intellectual history gives Otlet his due, restoring him to his proper place in the long continuum of visionaries and pioneers who have struggled to classify knowledge, from H.G. Wells and Melvil Dewey to Vannevar Bush, Ted Nelson, Tim Berners-Lee, and Steve Jobs. Wright shows that in the years since Otlet's death the world has witnessed the emergence of a global network that has proved him right about the possibilities--and the perils--of networked information, and his legacy persists in our digital world today, captured for all time.},

	abstract = {Presently, text mining is in a loosely organized set of competing technologies that function as analytical “city-states” with no clear dominance among them. To further complicate matters, different areas of text mining are in different stages of maturity. Some technology is easily accessible by practitioners today via commercial software (some of which is included with this book), while other areas are only now emerging from academia into the practical realm.We can relate these technologies to seven different practice areas in text mining that are covered in the chapters in this book. In summary, this book is strongest in the practice area of document classification, solid in concept extraction and document clustering, reasonably useful on web mining, light on information extraction and natural language processing, and almost silent on the (most popular) practice area of search and information retrieval.The unifying theme behind each of these technologies is the need to “turn text into numbers” so that powerful analytical algorithms can be applied to large document databases. Converting text into a structured, numerical format and applying analytic algorithms both require knowing how to use and combine techniques for handling text, ranging from individual words to documents to entire document databases.Next, we provide a decision tree to help you determine which practice area is appropriate to satisfy your needs. Finally, we provide tables to relate the practice areas to appropriate technologies and show which chapter in this book deals with that subject area. That is the most organization that we can impose on the current disordered state of text mining technology. Our goal in this book is to provide an introduction to each of the seven practice areas and cover in depth only those areas that are accessible for nonexperts. We will follow that theme in Part I of the book to provide you with the basics you need to perform the tutorials. Very quickly, you will be learning by doing.},

	abstract = {A lively, hands-on introduction for teachers and scholars in the humanities and social sciences, this book-and-CD package will inspire even the faint-hearted to take the technological bull by the horns and make efficient, informed use of computer and Internet resources.New technology is changing the very nature of research and teaching in the social sciences and humanities. From specialized online forums to Web-based teaching and distance learning, computers are being used to expand educational opportunities, promote cooperation and collaboration, stimulate creative thinking, and find answers to previously insoluble research problems. Combining interactive projects in a CD-ROM format with informative printed essays, this volume showcases innovations that are revolutionizing the craft of scholarship. More than that, it examines realistically how applicable the new technology is to learning. Contributors clarify some of the difficulties of using computers and address problems with the philosophy and culture of computers, including concerns about intellectual property protection and the potential for creating a technological underclass of electronically disadvantaged schools and universities.The accompanying CD features multimedia entries such as an interactive project on owls that educates users about forest ecology; RiverWeb, an interactive archive of information on the history, culture, and science of the Mississippi River; and "Global Jukebox," which recreates the context in which the folklorist Alan Lomax made his pioneering field recordings. The CD includes links to many external sites on the World Wide Web. For those with limited Internet access, a collection of relevant sites is integrated into the CD.

There are now hundreds of Digital Humanities centres worldwide and the subject is taught at both postgraduate and undergraduate level. Yet the term ‘Digital Humanities’ is much debated. This reader brings together, for the first time, in one core volume the essential readings that have emerged in Digital Humanities. We provide a historical overview of how the term ‘Humanities Computing’ developed into the term ‘Digital Humanities’, and highlight core readings which explore the meaning, scope, and implementation of the field. To contextualize and frame each included reading, the editors and authors provide a commentary on the original piece. There is also an annotated bibliography of other material not included in the text to provide an essential list of reading in the discipline. This text will be required reading for scholars and students who want to discover the history of Digital Humanities through its core writings, and for those who wish to understand the many possibilities that exist when trying to define Digital Humanities.},

The book then takes the reader step-by-step through planning a project, understanding the technologies involved and how to choose the appropriate ones, designing a site that is both easy-to-use and scholarly, digitizing materials in a way that makes them web-friendly while preserving their historical integrity, and how to reach and respond to an intended audience effectively. It also explores the repercussions of copyright law and fair use for scholars in a digital age, and examines more cutting-edge web techniques involving interactivity, such as sites that use the medium to solicit and collect historical artifacts. Finally, the book provides basic guidance on insuring that the digital history the reader creates will not disappear in a few years.},

Answering the question, "What is digital humanities?," it provides an in-depth examination of an emerging field. This collaboratively authored and visually compelling volume explores methodologies and techniques unfamiliar to traditional modes of humanistic inquiry--including geospatial analysis, data mining, corpus linguistics, visualization, and simulation--to show their relevance for contemporary culture. Included are chapters on the basics, on emerging methods and genres, and on the social life of the digital humanities, along with "case studies," "provocations," and "advisories." These persuasively crafted interventions offer a descriptive toolkit for anyone involved in the design, production, oversight, and review of digital projects. The authors argue that the digital humanities offers a revitalization of the liberal arts tradition in the electronically inflected, design-driven, multimedia language of the twenty-first century.Written by five leading practitioner-theorists whose varied backgrounds embody the intellectual and creative diversity of the field, Digital\_Humanities is a vision statement for the future, an invitation to engage, and a critical tool for understanding the shape of new scholarship.},

	abstract = {In Digital Methods, Richard Rogers proposes a methodological outlook for social and cultural scholarly research on the Web that seeks to move Internet research beyond the study of online culture. It is not a toolkit for Internet research, or operating instructions for a software package; it deals with broader questions. How can we study social media to learn something about society rather than about social media use? How can hyperlinks reveal not just the value of a Web site but the politics of association? Rogers proposes repurposing Web-native techniques for research into cultural change and societal conditions. We can learn to reapply such "methods of the medium" as crawling and crowd sourcing, PageRank and similar algorithms, tag clouds and other visualizations; we can learn how they handle hits, likes, tags, date stamps, and other Web-native objects. By "thinking along" with devices and the objects they handle, digital research methods can follow the evolving methods of the medium. Rogers uses this new methodological outlook to examine the findings of inquiries into 9/11 search results, the recognition of climate change skeptics by climate-change-related Web sites, the events surrounding the Srebrenica massacre according to Dutch, Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian Wikipedias, presidential candidates' social media "friends," and the censorship of the Iranian Web. With Digital Methods, Rogers introduces a new vision and method for Internet research and at the same time applies them to the Web's objects of study, from tiny particles (hyperlinks) to large masses (social media).},

	abstract = {How does a literary historian end up thinking in terms of z-scores, principal component analysis, and clustering coefficient?In the ten essays collected in this volume, Franco Moretti reconstructs the intellectual trajectory of his philosophy of ‘distant reading’. From the evolutionary model of ‘Modern European Literature’, through the geo-cultural dominant of ‘Conjectures on World Literature’ and ‘Planet Hollywood’ to the quantitative findings of ‘Style, inc.’ and the abstract patterns of ‘Network Theory, Plot Analysis’, the book follows two decades of critical explorations that have come to define – well beyond the wildest expectations of its author – a growing field of unorthodox literary studies.},

J’ai essayé d’extraire de mon expérience quelques principes généraux.Je commencerai en témoignant du fait que nous vivons de façon irréversible un âge numérique. J’expliquerai cela en présentant les trois périodes successives qui ont marqué le développement des relations entre sciences humaines et informatique, ainsi que les principes qui les ont portées. Enfin, pour parler de façon concrète, je présenterai le cas spécifique de mon expérience à Oxford, ce qui permettra d’approfondir l’état courant des recherches dans les sciences humaines et sociales (SHS) informatisées.Il y a toujours eu une vraie tension entre les deux méthodes opposées dont on peut se servir dans les sciences humaines et sociales et l’informatique ; une confrontation entre le texte et les données. Certains diront qu’on peut se servir d’un ordinateur pour faire du data processing, pour gérer des données : des chiffres, des faits, des observations, des objets, des tendances statistiques. Le texte, en revanche, est composé d’autres choses : de mots, d’une langue, de paroles, qui ont une existence tout à fait indépendante de leur représentation dans un format numérique. Les données numériques, elles, n’existent que dans leur expression informatisée. C’est précisément là que réside la tension entre les deux. Pour [...]},

It is argued that this renaming of humanities computing as digital humanities carries with it a set of epistemic commitments that are not necessarily compatible with a broad and inclusive notion of the digital humanities. In particular, the author suggests that tensions arise from the instrumental, textual and methodological focus of humanities computing as well as its relative lack of engagement with the "digital" as a study object. This article is the first in a series of four articles attempting to describe and analyze the field of digital humanities and digital humanities as a transformative practice.},

My efforts here will concentrate on taking this question apart and examining its major assumptions to see if we cannot make better questions. In passing I will also flag several areas of disciplinary research that we need to bring within our scope in order to address those better questions.},

L'informatica nel suo impatto con le applicazioni umanistiche ha avuto infatti conseguenze innovative e in costante mutamento. Il vasto mondo che ruota attorno alla funzione, produzione e ricezione del testo sta subendo una trasformazione radicale dovuta alle tecnologie, ma pochi sono in grado di apprezzarne compiutamente le origini e le ricadute sulla letteratura tutta.

In the first section the author introduces the concepts of concordance and lexical frequency, concepts which are then applied to a range of areas of language study. Key areas examined are the use of on-line corpora to complement traditional stylistic analysis, and the ways in which methods such as concordance and frequency counts can reveal a particular ideology within a text. Presenting an accessible and thorough understanding of the underlying principles of electronic text analysis, the book contains abundant illustrative examples and a glossary with definitions of main concepts.

Prior again to that, as recent work in the history of mapping has argued, the making of a map takes possession of and literally deﬁnes the mapped terrain: features are named (or re-named), relationships shown, boundaries indicated, unknown parts labelled – and so marked for exploration.},

This paper reviews a number of activities in the UK and Europe in the last 5 years which have sought to address these questions through processes of experimentation and targeted infrastructure development. In the UK, the AHeSSC (Arts and Humanities e-Science Support Centre) has played a coordinating role for seven projects funded by the Arts and Humanities e-Science Initiative. In Europe, DARIAH (Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities) has sought to develop a deeper understanding of research information and communication in the arts and humanities, and to inform the development of e-infrastructures accordingly. Both sets of activity have indicated a common requirement: to construct a framework which consistently describes the methods and functions of scholarly activity which underlie digital arts and humanities research, and the relationships between them. Such a ‘methodological commons’ has been formulated in the field of the digital humanities. This paper describes the application of this approach to arts and humanities e-Science, with reference to the early work of DARIAH and AHeSSC.},

We argue that the suitability and contribution of network science techniques within particular archaeological research contexts can be usefully explored by scrutinizing the past phenomena under study, how these are abstracted into concepts, and how these in turn are represented as network data. For this reason, each of the articles in this special issue is discussed in terms of the phenomena that they seek to address, the abstraction in terms of concepts that they use to study connectivity, and the representations of network data that they employ in their analyses. The approaches currently being used are diverse and interdisciplinary, which we think are evidence of a healthy exploratory stage in the application of network science in archaeology. To facilitate further innovation, application, and collaboration, we also provide a glossary of terms that are currently being used in network science and especially those in the applications to archaeological case studies.},

	abstract = {‘Reading by Numbers: Recalibrating the Literary Field’ proposes and demonstrates a new digital approach to literary history. Drawing on bibliographical information on the Australian novel in the AustLit database, the book addresses debates and issues in literary studies through a method that combines book history’s pragmatic approach to literary data with the digital humanities’ idea of computer modelling as an experimental and iterative practice. As well as showcasing this method, the case studies in ‘Reading by Numbers’ provide a revised history of the Australian novel, focusing on the nineteenth century and the decades since the end of the Second World War, and engaging with a range of themes including literary and cultural value, authorship, gender, genre and the transnational circulation of fiction. The book’s findings challenge established arguments in Australian literary studies, book history, feminism and gender studies, while presenting innovative ways of understanding literature, publishing, authorship and reading, and the relationships between them. More broadly, by demonstrating critical ways in which the growing number of digital archives in the humanities can be mined, modelled and visualised, ‘Reading by Numbers’ offers new directions and scope for digital humanities research.},

Nella prima parte viene discusso il rapporto fra la comunicazione scritta e i suoi supporti. Lo scopo è mostrare come l’impatto di ciascun sistema di media – informatica inclusa – dia luogo a risultati complessi e contradditori intrecciandosi con fenomeni sociali, culturali, economici. Nella seconda parte l’autore analizza le principali forme della testualità digitale, dalle sue origini (la videoscrittura, l’ipertesto) ai giorni nostri (la comunicazione interattiva, i giochi di ruolo, la retorica del Web). Vengono poi affrontati i nodi teorici e pratici del rapporto fra critica testuale e digitalizzazione del documento. Prendendo spunto dallo studio delle varianti d’autore viene presentato Varianti digitali, un archivio on-line per la didattica e lo studio del processo di scrittura.

	abstract = {Software has replaced a diverse array of physical, mechanical, and electronic technologies used before 21st century to create, store, distribute and interact with cultural artifacts. It has become our interface to the world, to others, to our memory and our imagination - a universal language through which the world speaks, and a universal engine on which the world runs. What electricity and combustion engine were to the early 20th century, software is to the early 21st century. Offering the the first theoretical and historical account of software for media authoring and its effects on the practice and the very concept of 'media,' the author of The Language of New Media (2001) develops his own theory for this rapidly-growing, always-changing field. What was the thinking and motivations of people who in the 1960 and 1970s created concepts and practical techniques that underlie contemporary media software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Maya, Final Cut and After Effects? How do their interfaces and tools shape the visual aesthetics of contemporary media and design? What happens to the idea of a 'medium' after previously media-specific tools have been simulated and extended in software? Is it still meaningful to talk about different mediums at all? Lev Manovich answers these questions and supports his theoretical arguments by detailed analysis of key media applications such as Photoshop and After Effects, popular web services such as Google Earth, and the projects in motion graphics, interactive environments, graphic design and architecture. Software Takes Command is a must for all practicing designers and media artists and scholars concerned with contemporary media.},

For symptomatic readers, texts possess meanings that are veiled, latent, all but absent if it were not for their irrepressible and recurring symptoms. Noting the recent trend away from ideological demystification, this essay proposes various modes of "surface reading" that together strive to accurately depict the truth to which a text bears witness. Surface reading broadens the scope of critique to include the kinds of interpretive activity that seek to understand the complexity of literary surfaces---surfaces that have been rendered invisible by symptomatic reading.},

	abstract = {In 1995 in the midst of the first widespread wave of digitization, the Modern Language Association issued a Statement on the Significance of Primary Records in order to assert the importance of retaining books and other physical artifacts even after they have been microfilmed or scanned for general consumption. "A primary record," the MLA told us then, "can appropriately be defined as a physical object produced or used at the particular past time that one is concerned with in a given instance" (27). Today, the conceit of a "primary record" can no longer be assumed to be coterminous with that of a "physical object." Electronic texts, files, feeds, and transmissions of all sorts are also now, indisputably, primary records. In the specific domain of the literary, a writer working today will not and cannot be studied in the future in the same way as writers of the past, because the basic material evidence of their authorial activity — manuscripts and drafts, working notes, correspondence, journals — is, like all textual production, increasingly migrating to the electronic realm. This essay therefore seeks to locate and triangulate the emergence of a .txtual condition — I am of course remediating Jerome McGann’s influential notion of a “textual condition” — amid our contemporary constructions of the "literary", along with the changing nature of literary archives, and lastly activities in the digital humanities as that enterprise is now construed. In particular, I will use the example of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland as a means of illustrating the kinds of resources and expertise a working digital humanities center can bring to the table when confronted with the range of materials that archives and manuscript repositories will increasingly be receiving.},

The artificial distinctions that have replicated the discipline divisions have become less relevant to those working in digital humanities, who often group around subject matter, not training. Add to this the increasing breakdown of national boundaries in literary studies, and perhaps it seems antiquated or anathema to reproduce American as a term with which to saddle a supposedly cutting-edge collection of essays.},

It discusses the prospects for partnership between the humanities and computing from the alternative perspective afforded by Empirical Modelling (EM). Perceived dualities that separate the two cultures of science and art are identified as the primary impediment to this partnership. A vision for ‘human computing’ that promises to dissolve these dualities is outlined. The key characteristics and potential for EM for the humanities are illustrated with reference to a modelling exercise on the theme of Schubert's Erlkönig. This highlights how each of the six varieties of modelling identified by McCarty can be represented within an EM model. The implications of EM are discussed with reference to McCarty's account of the key role for modelling in the humanities, in relation to James's ‘philosophic attitude’ of Radical Empiricism and to ideas from phenomenological sources.},

A case study measuring the OCR accuracy of the British Library's 19th Century Newspapers Database provides a clear example of the benefits to be gained from measuring not just character accuracy but also word and significant word accuracy. As OCR primarily facilitates searching, indexing and other means of structuring the user experience of online newspaper archives, measuring the word and significant word accuracy of the OCR output is very revealing of a resource's likely performance for these functions. Having such data is therefore extremely helpful for planning and quality assurance assessment. After briefly discussing the role of OCR in the text capture process and how OCR works, we give a detailed description of the methodology, statistical data gathering techniques and analysis used in this study. Our conclusions point the way forward with suggested actions to assist other mass digitization projects in applying these techniques.},

	abstract = {Among mass digitization methods, double-keying is considered to be the one with the lowest error rate. This method requires two independent transcriptions of a text by two different operators. It is particularly well suited to historical texts, which often exhibit deficiencies like poor master copies or other difficulties such as spelling variation or complex text structures.            Providers of data entry services using the double-keying method generally advertise very high accuracy rates (around 99.95\% to 99.98\%). These advertised percentages are generally estimated on the basis of small samples, and little if anything is said about either the actual amount of text or the text genres which have been proofread, about error types, proofreaders, etc. In order to obtain significant data on this problem it is necessary to analyze a large amount of text representing a balanced sample of different text types, to distinguish the structural XML/TEI level from the typographical level, and to differentiate between various types of errors which may originate from different sources and may not be equally severe.         This paper presents an extensive and complex approach to the analysis and correction of double-keying errors which has been applied by the DFG-funded project "Deutsches Textarchiv" (German Text Archive, hereafter DTA) in order to evaluate and preferably to increase the transcription and annotation accuracy of double-keyed DTA texts. Statistical analyses of the results gained from proofreading a large quantity of text are presented, which verify the common accuracy rates for the double-keying method.},

	abstract = {The question of modeling arises naturally for humanities computing from the prior question of what its practitioners across the disciplines have in common. What are they all doing with their computers that we might find in their diverse activities indications of a coherent or cohesible practice? How do we make the best, most productive sense of what we observe? There are, of course, many answers: practice varies from person to person, from project to project, and ways of construing it perhaps vary even more. In this chapter I argue for modeling as a model of such a practice. I have three confluent goals: to identify humanities computing with an intellectual ground shared by the older disciplines, so that we may say how and to what extent our field is of as well as in the humanities, how it draws from and adds to them; at the same time to reflect experience with computers "in the wild"; and to aim at the most challenging problems, and so the most intellectually rewarding future now imaginable.},

	abstract = {More and more historical texts are becoming available in digital form. Digitization of paper documents is motivated by the aim of preserving cultural heritage and making it more accessible, both to laypeople and scholars. As digital images cannot be searched for text, digitization projects increasingly strive to create digital text, which can be searched and otherwise automatically processed, in addition to facsimiles. Indeed, the emerging field of digital humanities heavily relies on the availability of digital text for its studies.Together with the increasing availability of historical texts in digital form, there is a growing interest in applying natural language processing (NLP) methods and tools to historical texts. However, the specific linguistic properties of historical texts -- the lack of standardized orthography, in particular -- pose special challenges for NLP.This book aims to give an introduction to NLP for historical texts and an overview of the state of the art in this field. The book starts with an overview of methods for the acquisition of historical texts (scanning and OCR), discusses text encoding and annotation schemes, and presents examples of corpora of historical texts in a variety of languages. The book then discusses specific methods, such as creating part-of-speech taggers for historical languages or handling spelling variation. A final chapter analyzes the relationship between NLP and the digital humanities.Certain recently emerging textual genres, such as SMS, social media, and chat messages, or newsgroup and forum postings share a number of properties with historical texts, for example, nonstandard orthography and grammar, and profuse use of abbreviations. The methods and techniques required for the effective processing of historical texts are thus also of interest for research in other domains.},

	abstract = {For centuries, music has been shared and remembered by two traditions: aural transmission and in the form of written documents normally called musical scores. Many of these scores exist in the form of unpublished manuscripts and hence they are in danger of being lost through the normal ravages of time. To preserve the music some form of typesetting or, ideally, a computer system that can automatically decode the symbolic images and create new scores is required. Programs analogous to optical character recognition systems called optical music recognition (OMR) systems have been under intensive development for many years. However, the results to date are far from ideal. Each of the proposed methods emphasizes different properties and therefore makes it difficult to effectively evaluate its competitive advantages. This article provides an overview of the literature concerning the automatic analysis of images of printed and handwritten musical scores. For self-containment and for the benefit of the reader, an introduction to OMR processing systems precedes the literature overview. The following study presents a reference scheme for any researcher wanting to compare new OMR algorithms against well-known ones.},

	abstract = {In 1995 in the midst of the first widespread wave of digitization, the Modern Language Association issued a Statement on the Significance of Primary Records in order to assert the importance of retaining books and other physical artifacts even after they have been microfilmed or scanned for general consumption. "A primary record," the MLA told us then, "can appropriately be defined as a physical object produced or used at the particular past time that one is concerned with in a given instance" (27). Today, the conceit of a "primary record" can no longer be assumed to be coterminous with that of a "physical object." Electronic texts, files, feeds, and transmissions of all sorts are also now, indisputably, primary records. In the specific domain of the literary, a writer working today will not and cannot be studied in the future in the same way as writers of the past, because the basic material evidence of their authorial activity — manuscripts and drafts, working notes, correspondence, journals — is, like all textual production, increasingly migrating to the electronic realm. This essay therefore seeks to locate and triangulate the emergence of a .txtual condition — I am of course remediating Jerome McGann’s influential notion of a “textual condition” — amid our contemporary constructions of the "literary", along with the changing nature of literary archives, and lastly activities in the digital humanities as that enterprise is now construed. In particular, I will use the example of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland as a means of illustrating the kinds of resources and expertise a working digital humanities center can bring to the table when confronted with the range of materials that archives and manuscript repositories will increasingly be receiving.},

	abstract = {Recent research on annotation interfaces provides provocative evidence that anchored, annotation-based discussion environments may lead to better conversations about a text. However, annotation interfaces raise complicated tradeoffs regarding screen real estate and positioning. It is argued that solving this screen real estate problem requires limiting the number of annotations displayed to users. In order to understand which annotations have the most learning value for students, this paper presents two complementary studies examining the effects of annotations on students performing a reading-to-write task. The first study used think-aloud protocols and a within-subjects methodology, finding that annotations appeared to provoke students to reflect more critically upon the primary text. This effect was particularly strong when students encountered pairs of annotations presenting different viewpoints on the same section of text. Student interviews suggested that annotations were most helpful when they caused the reader to consider and weigh conflicting viewpoints. The second study used a between-subjects methodology and a more naturalistic task to provide complementary evidence that annotations encourage more reflective responses to a text. This study found that students who received annotated materials both perceived themselves and were perceived by instructors as less reliant on unreflective summary strategies than students who received the same content but in a different format. These findings indicate that the learning value of an annotation lies in its ability to provoke students to consider and weigh new perspectives on the primary text. When selected effectively, annotations provide a critical scaffolding that can support students’ critical thinking and argumentation activities. Collaborative digital libraries and applications for the Web 2.0 should be designed with this learning framework in mind.},

After briefly reviewing the history of canonical references I note how they have been used so far, emphasizing the advances made by Canonical Text Services (CTS). I argue that the practical and theoretical problems that remain unaddressed require engagement with descriptions of how textual scholarship works and how notional literary works relate to the artefacts that carry them (using Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records, FRBR). By correlating a theory of canonical reference numbers with those two models — editorial workflow and creative works — I offer key principles that should be addressed when planning, writing, and using digital projects.},

Moreover, comic books are exceptionally complex documents, with intricate relationships between pictorial and textual elements and a wide variety of content types within a single comic book publication.

Comic Book Markup Language, or CBML, is a TEI-based XML vocabulary for encoding and analyzing comic books, comics, graphic novels, and related documents. This article discusses the goals and motivations for developing CBML, reviews the various content types found in comic book publications, provides an overview and examples of the key features of the CBML XML vocabulary, explores some of the problems and challenges in the encoding and digital representation of comic books, and outlines plans for future work. The structural, textual, visual, and bibliographic complexity of comic books make them an excellent subject for the general study of complex documents, especially documents combining pictorial and textual elements.},

It discusses the prospects for partnership between the humanities and computing from the alternative perspective afforded by Empirical Modelling (EM). Perceived dualities that separate the two cultures of science and art are identified as the primary impediment to this partnership. A vision for ‘human computing’ that promises to dissolve these dualities is outlined. The key characteristics and potential for EM for the humanities are illustrated with reference to a modelling exercise on the theme of Schubert's Erlkönig. This highlights how each of the six varieties of modelling identified by McCarty can be represented within an EM model. The implications of EM are discussed with reference to McCarty's account of the key role for modelling in the humanities, in relation to James's ‘philosophic attitude’ of Radical Empiricism and to ideas from phenomenological sources.},

	abstract = {This article describes the work performed in the Pattern Redundancy Analysis for Document Image Indexing and Transcription research project. The project focused on layout analysis, text/graphics separation, optical character recognition (OCR), and text transcription processes dedicated to old and precious books. The originality of this work relies on the analysis and exploitation of pattern redundancy in documents to enable the efficient indexing and quick transcription of books and the identification of typographic materials. For these purposes, we have developed two software packages. The first, AGORA, performs page layout analysis, text/graphics separation, and pattern (letterform) extraction simultaneously. These patterns are then processed to group similar patterns together in single clusters so that different letterforms of a book can be extracted and analysed to compute redundancy rates. This process allows a significant reduction of the number of letterforms to be recognized. Once the clustering of letterforms is done, a user may assign a label to each cluster using the second software, RETRO. Labels are then automatically assigned to each corresponding character to perform the text transcription of the whole book. Thus, if 90\% of the letterforms are detected as redundant, only one character out of ten must be labelled by the user to transcribe the book. Moreover, this transcription method allows us to deal easily with the special characters that appear frequently in old books. It is also possible to use our clustering approach to extract and create new font packages from specific printing material (e.g. from rare books printed with particular types or woodblocks). These new font packages could be incorporated into the training step of optical fonts recognition methods to improve the recognition results of OCRs on rare or specific books. The identification of typographic materials could also be useful for the study of both the aesthetic (such as how the thickness and shape of printing types evolved from the 15th to the mid-16th century) and economic aspects of printing historically. Until the second half of the 16th century, for instance, printing types circulated among workshops, and printers frequently sold or lent types to their fellows.},

The Islandora framework is designed to ease the management of security and workflow for digital assets, and to help implementers create custom interfaces for display, search, and discovery. Turnkey options are provided via tools and modules ("solution packs") designed to support the work of a particular knowledge domain (such as chemistry), a particular content type (such as a digitized newspaper), or a particular task (such as TEI encoding). While it does not yet have native support for TEI, Islandora provides a promising basis on which digital humanities scholars could manage the creation, editing, validation, display, and comparison of TEI-encoded text. UPEI's IslandLives project, with its forthcoming solution pack, provides insight into how an Islandora version 6 installation can support OCR text extraction, automatic structural/semantic encoding of text, and web-based TEI editing and display functions for site administrators. This article introduces the Islandora framework and its suitability for TEI, describes the IslandLives approach in detail, and briefly discusses recent work and future directions for TEI work in Islandora. The authors hope that interested readers may help contribute to the expansion of TEI-related services and features available to be used with Islandora.},

One chapter of Wieland that clusters with the Carwin chapters is narrated by the same character who narrates all of Carwin, thus providing statistical evidence that Brown has created a narrator with a distinctive voice. Accounting for the clustering of the other two chapters calls for a consideration of several of the more crucial and problematic interpretative issues in the novel, and suggests that quantitative analysis can indeed provide background and evidence for literary critical discussion and understanding.},

	abstract = {The field of narrative (or story) understanding and generation is one of the oldest in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI), which is hardly surprising, since storytelling is such a fundamental and familiar intellectual and social activity. In recent years, the demands of interactive entertainment and interest in the creation of engaging narratives with life-like characters have provided a fresh impetus to this field. This book provides an overview of the principal problems, approaches, and challenges faced today in modeling the narrative structure of stories. The book introduces classical narratological concepts from literary theory and their mapping to computational approaches. It demonstrates how research in AI and NLP has modeled character goals, causality, and time using formalisms from planning, case-based reasoning, and temporal reasoning, and discusses fundamental limitations in such approaches. It proposes new representations for embedded narratives and fictional entities, for assessing the pace of a narrative, and offers an empirical theory of audience response. These notions are incorporated into an annotation scheme called NarrativeML. The book identifies key issues that need to be addressed, including annotation methods for long literary narratives, the representation of modality and habituality, and characterizing the goals of narrators. It also suggests a future characterized by advanced text mining of narrative structure from large-scale corpora and the development of a variety of useful authoring aids.This is the first book to provide a systematic foundation that integrates together narratology, AI, and computational linguistics. It can serve as a narratology primer for computer scientists and an elucidation of computational narratology for literary theorists. It is written in a highly accessible manner and is intended for use by a broad scientific audience that includes linguists (computational and formal semanticists), AI researchers, cognitive scientists, computer scientists, game developers, and narrative theorists.},

	abstract = {Works of imagination encourage interpreters, who respond in diverse and inventive ways. The variety of critical practices--indeed, the number of differing interpretations directed at the same works--can obscure the theoretical commonality that holds those practices together. We can draw an immediate distinction, however, between critical practices which do or do not aim to be interpretive: bibliographical studies and prosodic analysis, for example, typically discount their interpretive moves, if any are explicitly engaged.The usual object of interpretation is "meaning," or some set of ideas that can be cast in thematic form. These meanings are sought in different ways: as though resident "in" the work, or evoked through "reader-response," or deconstructable through a process that would reinstall a structure of intelligibility at a higher, more critical level. The contemporary terminology will not obscure the long-standing character of such practices, which can be mixed in various ways. In all these cases, however, an essential relation is preserved between an artistic work and some structure of ideas, that is, some conceptual form that gets more or less fully articulated "for" the work. To understand a work of art, interpreters try to close with a structure of thought that represents its essential idea(s).In this paper we want to propose--or recall--another way of engaging imaginative work. Perhaps as ancient as more normative practices, it has been less in vogue for some time. This alternative does not stand opposed to interpretive procedures as such, nor to the elaboration of conceptual equivalents for imaginative work. But it does try to set these modes of exegesis on a new footing. The alternative moves to break beyond conceptual analysis into the kinds of knowledge involved in performative operations--a practice of everyday imaginative life. We will argue that concept-based interpretation, reading along thematic lines, is itself best understood as a particular type of performative and rhetorical operation.},

One of its key features is the ability to display the spatialization process, aiming at transforming the network into a map, and ForceAtlas2 is its default layout algorithm. The latter is developed by the Gephi team as an all-around solution to Gephi users’ typical networks (scale-free, 10 to 10,000 nodes). We present here for the first time its functioning and settings. ForceAtlas2 is a force-directed layout close to other algorithms used for network spatialization. We do not claim a theoretical advance but an attempt to integrate different techniques such as the Barnes Hut simulation, degree-dependent repulsive force, and local and global adaptive temperatures. It is designed for the Gephi user experience (it is a continuous algorithm), and we explain which constraints it implies. The algorithm benefits from much feedback and is developed in order to provide many possibilities through its settings. We lay out its complete functioning for the users who need a precise understanding of its behaviour, from the formulas to graphic illustration of the result. We propose a benchmark for our compromise between performance and quality. We also explain why we integrated its various features and discuss our design choices.},

In this article we take a few steps in the direction of establishing such a foundation. Our approach is based on graphical perception—the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs—and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theory. The theory deals with a small but important piece of the whole process of graphical perception. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer alternative graphical forms—dot charts, dot charts with grouping, and framed-rectangle charts.},

It discusses the prospects for partnership between the humanities and computing from the alternative perspective afforded by Empirical Modelling (EM). Perceived dualities that separate the two cultures of science and art are identified as the primary impediment to this partnership. A vision for ‘human computing’ that promises to dissolve these dualities is outlined. The key characteristics and potential for EM for the humanities are illustrated with reference to a modelling exercise on the theme of Schubert's Erlkönig. This highlights how each of the six varieties of modelling identified by McCarty can be represented within an EM model. The implications of EM are discussed with reference to McCarty's account of the key role for modelling in the humanities, in relation to James's ‘philosophic attitude’ of Radical Empiricism and to ideas from phenomenological sources.},

These tools carry with them assumptions of knowledge as observer-independent and certain, rather than observer co-dependent and interpretative. This paper argues that we need a humanities approach to the graphical expression of interpretation. To begin, the concept of data as a given has to be rethought through a humanistic lens and characterized as capta, taken and constructed. Next, the forms for graphical expression of capta need to be more nuanced to show ambiguity and complexity. Finally, the use of a humanistic approach, rooted in a co-dependent relation between observer and experience, needs to be expressed according to graphics built from interpretative models. In summary: all data have to be understood as capta and the conventions created to express observer-independent models of knowledge need to be radically reworked to express humanistic interpretation.},

Certaines de ces problématiques commencent à être abordées par des personnes qui se revendiquent du mouvement des « humanités numériques ». Nous montrons que la faiblesse argumentative des représentants de ce mouvement est moins préoccupante pour les scientifiques que la facilité avec laquelle ils se font entendre : outre le dévoilement sociologique du monde universitaire actuel, toujours instructif, ce n’est pas tant l’essor des « humanités numériques » qui pose problème (parce qu’elles seraient mal définies ou joueraient d’un oxymore peu efficace épistémologiquement) que le silence de représentants des « SHS » quant à l’évolution des contours de chacune de leur discipline sous l’effet de l’écriture contemporaine.

What are they all doing with their computers that we might find in their diverse activities indications of a coherent or cohesible practice?

There are, of course, many answers: practice varies from person to person, from project to project, and ways of construing it perhaps vary even more. In this chapter I argue for modeling as a model of such a practice. I have three confluent goals: to identify humanities computing with an intellectual ground shared by the older disciplines, so that we may say how and to what extent our field is of as well as in the humanities, how it draws from and adds to them; at the same time to reflect experience with computers "in the wild"; and to aim at the most challenging problems, and so the most intellectually rewarding future now imaginable.},

This activity is characterized byemergence, where the participants' shared understanding develops gradually as they interact with each other and the source material. Our goal is to support collaborative interpretation by small, distributed groups. To achieve this, we first observed how face-to-face groups perform collaborative interpretation in a particular work context. We then synthesized design principles from two relevant areas: the key behaviors of people engaged in activities where emergence occurs, and how distributed groups work together over visual surfaces. We built and evaluated a system that supports a specific collaborative interpretation task. This system provides a large workspace and several objects that encourages emergence in interpretation. People manipulatecardsthat contain the raw information fragments. They reduce complexity by placing duplicate cards intopiles. They suggest groupings as they manipulate the spatial layout of cards and piles. They enrich spatial layouts throughnotes, textandfreehand annotations. They record their understanding of their final groupings asreportscontaining coherent descriptions.},

How do the 3.1 billion A, C, G and T letters of the human genome compare to those of a chimp or a mouse? What do the paths that millions of visitors take through a web site look like? With Visualizing Data, you learn how to answer complex questions like these with thoroughly interactive displays. We're not talking about cookie-cutter charts and graphs. This book teaches you how to design entire interfaces around large, complex data sets with the help of a powerful new design and prototyping tool called "Processing". Used by many researchers and companies to convey specific data in a clear and understandable manner, the Processing beta is available free. With this tool and Visualizing Data as a guide, you'll learn basic visualization principles, how to choose the right kind of display for your purposes, and how to provide interactive features that will bring users to your site over and over. This book teaches you: The seven stages of visualizing data -- acquire, parse, filter, mine, represent, refine, and interactHow all data problems begin with a question and end with a narrative construct that provides a clear answer without extraneous detailsSeveral example projects with the code to make them workPositive and negative points of each representation discussed. The focus is on customization so that each one best suits what you want to convey about your data set The book does not provide ready-made "visualizations" that can be plugged into any data set. Instead, with chapters divided by types of data rather than types of display, you'll learn how each visualization conveys the unique properties of the data it represents -- why the data was collected, what's interesting about it, and what stories it can tell.

Since that time, scholars' definitions of literature and their rationales for teaching it have changed radically. But the periodized structure of the curriculum has remained oddly unshaken, as if the exercise of contrasting one literary period with another has an importance that transcends the content of any individual course.Why Literary Periods Mattered explains how historical contrast became central to literary study, and why it remained institutionally central in spite of critical controversy about literature itself. Organizing literary history around contrast rather than causal continuity helped literature departments separate themselves from departments of history. But critics' long reliance on a rhetoric of contrasted movements and fateful turns has produced important blind spots in the discipline. In the twenty-first century, Underwood argues, literary study may need digital technology in particular to develop new methods of reasoning about gradual, continuous change.},

A major finding from the project was that policy is far more important in guaranteeing persistence of identifiers than technology. Key policy questions for guaranteeing identifier persistence include: what entities should be assigned persistent identifiers, how should those identifiers be exposed to services, and what guarantees does the provider make on how long various facets of the identifiers will persist.To make an informed decision about what to identify, information modelling of the domain is critical. Identifier managers need to know what can be identified discretely (including not only concrete artefacts like files, but also abstractions such as works, versions, presentations, and aggregations); and for which of those objects it is a priority for users and managers to keep track. Without working out what actually needs to be identified, the commitment to keep identifiers persistent becomes meaningless.To make sure persistent identifiers meet these requirements, the PILIN project has formulated a six-point checklist for integrating identifiers into information management, which we present here.},

	abstract = {Discussion of digital identifiers, and persistent identifiers in particular, has often been confused by differences in underlying assumptions and approaches. To bring more clarity to such discussions, the PILIN Project has devised an abstract model of identifiers and identifier services, which is presented here in summary. Given such an abstract model, it is possible to compare different identifier schemes, despite variations in terminology; and policies and strategies can be formulated for persistence without committing to particular systems. The abstract model is formal and layered; in this article, we give an overview of the distinctions made in the model. This presentation is not exhaustive, but it presents some of the key concepts represented, and some of the insights that result.The main goal of the Persistent Identifier Linking Infrastructure (PILIN) project [1] has been to scope the infrastructure necessary for a national persistent identifier service. There are a variety of approaches and technologies already on offer for persistent digital identification of objects. But true identity persistence cannot be bound to particular technologies, domain policies, or information models: any formulation of a persistent identifier strategy needs to outlast current technologies, if the identifiers are to remain persistent in the long term.For that reason, PILIN has modelled the digital identifier space in the abstract. It has arrived at an ontology [2] and a service model [3] for digital identifiers, and for how they are used and managed, building on previous work in the identifier field [4] (including the thinking behind URI [5], DOI [6], XRI [7] and ARK [8]), as well as semiotic theory [9]. The ontology, as an abstract model, addresses the question ‘what is (and isn’t) an identifier?’ and ‘what does an identifier management system do?’. This more abstract view also brings clarity to the ongoing conversation of whether URIs can be (and should be) universal persistent identifiers.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the importance of relevance and rigor in scholarly publishing in a new media–rich world. We defend that scholarship should be useful and engaging to audiences through the use of new media, and at the same time scholarly publishers must develop and maintain methods of ensuring content accuracy and providing quality controls in the production of scholarly multimedia products. We review examples and a case study of existing scholarly publishing venues that attempt to maintain quality control standards while embracing innovative multimedia formats. We also present lessons learned from the case experience and challenges that face us in the scholarly publication of multimedia.},

Science Citation Index has since established itself as the gold standard for scientific information retrieval. It has also become the database of choice for citation analysts and evaluative bibliometricians worldwide. As scientific publication moves to the web, and novel approaches to scholarly communication and peer review establish themselves, new methods of citation and link analysis will emerge to capture often liminal expressions of peer esteem, influence and approbation. The web thus affords bibliometricians rich opportunities to apply and adapt their techniques to new contexts and content: the age of ‘bibliometric spectroscopy’ [2] is dawning.},

This book–length study of a now everyday phenomenon provides a close look at blogging while placing it in a historical, theoretical and contemporary context. Scholars, students and bloggers will find a lively survey of blogging that contextualises blogs in terms of critical theory and the history of digital media. Authored by a scholar–blogger, the book is packed with examples that show how blogging and related genres are changing media and communication. It gives definitions and explains how blogs work, shows how blogs relate to the historical development of publishing and communication and looks at the ways blogs structure social networks and at how social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook incorporate blogging in their design. Specific kinds of blogs discussed include political blogs, citizen journalism, confessional blogs and commercial blogs.},

Data publication is becoming increasingly important to the scientific community, as it will provide a mechanism for those who create data to receive academic credit for their work and will allow the conclusions arising from an analysis to be more readily verifiable, thus promoting transparency in the scientific process. Peer review of data will also provide a mechanism for ensuring the quality of datasets, and we provide suggestions on the types of activities one expects to see in the peer review of data. A simple taxonomy of data publication methodologies is presented and evaluated, and the paper concludes with a discussion of dataset granularity, transience and semantics, along with a recommended human-readable citation syntax.},

And in theory the URI space under your domain name is totally under your control, so you can make it as stable as you like.

This paper presents an overview of a preservation analysis methodology which was developed in response to that need on the CASPAR and Digital Curation Centre SCARP projects. We intend to place it in relation to other digital preservation practices, discussing how they can interact to provide archives caring for scientific data sets with the full arsenal of tools and techniques necessary to rise to this challenge.},
